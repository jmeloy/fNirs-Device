This is the code and presentation files that Liam Healy and I created for our computer science capstone at Tulane. The capstone poster will explain the project, but I will provide a demonstration video below as well. 

Note: The unity files created were much too large to fully uplload (textures, etc.), but C# code used on the tree is provided ()
